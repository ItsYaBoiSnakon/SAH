Hi! :wave: 
Welcome to my SAH Project page! My name is Snak0n, and i code Python & Java in my free time. Besides that, I recently started making a program for the company I work for. 

Student aan Huis (roughly translated, "Student at House") is a Dutch company that hires students all over the Netherlands for IT related problems that people experience.
Your printer is not working? Your PC keeps crashing? Your email cannot be send? Multiple error's in your screen? We could have a student near your home that knows how to fix that!. And even better, if we don't have someone nearby, our experts at the office can help by working on your computer with TeamViewer, while calling you.

While we do fix IT problems, we also have some problems of our own at the office. To make things easier, i code and design small software.

## Shortage problems, and where to find them
Currently we have shortage of students at several locations. Everytime a customer calls us, and we note down we don't have a available student near them, we write that down in our system.
After a while, we can convert all that data into a excel sheet.

Currently the one that i'm working one is a "Excel-to-graph"program in python. Excel itself does have several functions to make a bar graph, but sometimes it's a bit too much for the average user. 
My company constantly has new data of customers, and want's a easy way to change all that data into a bar graph. 

The formatting from data to graph is already simple. For those interested for a long explenation, i'm writing one soon.
But for a TL;DR: I convert the excel to a csv, read the data from csv to an array, and make a graph using matplotlib.
